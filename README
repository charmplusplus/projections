*** Last Update: October 2016 by Ronak Buch

TO COMPILE PROJECTIONS:
----------------------

1) Make sure the JDK commands "java", "javac" and "jar"
   are in your path. You should use at least java version 1.6,
   and your java and javac should be of the same version.
   You also need "gradle" (https://gradle.org/) and, optionally,
   the GNU tool "make".

2) Type "make" (or "gradle copyJarToBin" if you don't have "make").

3) The following files will be located in 'bin':

      projections           : Starts projections, for UNIX machines
      projections.bat       : Starts projections, for Windows machines
      projections.jar       : archive of all the java and image files


TO RUN PROJECTIONS:
------------------

1.) From any location, type
	> PROJECTIONS_LOCATION/bin/projections

where PROJECTIONS_LOCATION is the path to the main projections
directory.

HOW TO USE PROJECTIONS:
-----------------------
Projections is a visualization tool to help you understand and analyze what it
happening in your parallel (Charm++) program.  To use Projections, you first
have to make sure that Charm++ is compiled with tracing enabled and that your
program is compiled with the Projections tracemode.  Usually, this means adding
'--enable-tracing' to your Charm++ build options and '-tracemode projections'
to your program compile options.  When you run your program compiled with this
tracemode, a log file will be created for each processor.  An additional state
file will also be created.  The names of the log files will be NAME.#.log, where
NAME is the name of your executable and # is the processor #.  The name of the
state file is NAME.sts.

If your environment is set up correctly, as described in the previous section,
all you have to do to start Projections is type 'projections' at the prompt.

When Projections starts, you will see the main window with a toolbar with three
options, File, Tools, and Debug.

To begin using Projections, use "File -> Open File(s)" to select the data you
want to analyze.  To do so, navigate to the directory containing your data and
select the *.sts file.  If you have selected a valid file, Projections will load
in some preliminary data from the files and then activate the rest of the buttons
in the main window.  If your file is invalid, you will be shown an error dialog.

After opening a file, there are many different tools you can use to analyze your
data:

  1. Timelines
  2. Usage Profile
  3. Communication Per Processor
  4. Communication Over Time
  5. Call Table
  6. View Log Files
  7. Histograms
  8. Overview
  9. Animation
  10. Time Profile
  11. Performance Counters
  12. User Events
  13. User Stats Over Time
  14. User Stats Per Processor
  15. Extrema Analysis
  16. Multirun Analysis
  17. Noise Miner
  18. Streaming CCS
  19. Memory Usage


1. Timelines
------------
   The Timelines window lets you look at what a specific processor is doing at
   each moment of the program.

   When the Timelines window first appears, a dialog box appears along with it.
   The box asks for the following information:

   - Processors:  Choose which processor(s) you want to see a timeline for.
                    To enter multiple values, separate them with a comma or a
                    dash (for ranges).  Strides can be specified by
                    using a colon to denote the stride size.  Some
                    examples:

                      ex: Want to see processors 1,3,5,7:  Enter 1-7:2
                      ex: Want to see processors 1,2,3,4:  Enter 1-4
                      ex: Want to see processors 1,2,3,7:  Enter 1-3,7

   - Start Time  : Choose what time you want your timeline to start at.
   - End Time    : Choose what time you want your timeline to end at.

   The dialog box tells you what the valid processor choices are, as well as what
   the valid time ranges are.

   Particular time/processor ranges can be saved by using the "Add to
   History List" button, which will save the currently selected
   processors and time range for later use.  The dropdown menu above
   the button shows the current saved ranges.  Particular ranges can
   be removed by clicking the "Remove Selected History" button and the
   history can be saved to disk for future runs using the "Save
   History to Disk" button.

   To select annotated timesteps, click the "Find Annotated Timesteps"
   button. This finds user supplied notes on PE 0 that contain the
   sigil "***".  The times that these notes were made on PE 0 are
   annotated timesteps. After clicking the button, two dropdown
   containing the names of the annotated timesteps are displayed, and
   you can then select which timesteps you would like to use for the
   start and end times of the range.

   There are options to filter out entries shorter than a certain
   time, filter out messages, filter out user events, and highlight
   the top n longest idle and entry times.

   To automatically select the portion of the execution with valid
   performance data, click on "Adjust ranges to show useful
   information" at the bottom of the window.

   When you are satisfied with your time and processor ranges, click on 'OK'.
   Projections will then get the Timeline data for you.  The time for this step
   depends on the number of items in your time range and the number of
   processors you have chosen.

   The Timeline Window consists of two parts:

   1) Display Panel:
      This is where the timelines are displayed and is the largest portion of
      the window.  The time axis is displayed at the top of the panel,
      and the units are microseconds.  The left side of the panel
      shows the processor labels.  Underneath each label are two numbers, the first
      indicating the percentage of the total time in your
      timeline that particular PE spent busy during the execution, and
      the second indicating the percentage of the total time that PE
      spent actually working on the application's entry methods.  The
      timeline itself consists of colored bars for each
      work item.  Placing the cursor over one of these bars will bring up a
      pop-up window telling you the name of that item, the begin time, the end
      time, and the total time.  It will also tell you what amount of time was
      spent packing, how many messages were created during this work item, and
      which processor created this item.  If you click on the item, by
      default, a line will be traced from the work item to the sender
      of the message responsible for this work item.  This behavior
      can be modified by selecting different options in the Tracing menu
      item.  Additionally, right clicking on a work item brings up a
      context menu, allowing you to view more details of that work
      item, change the color of that entry method, and drop or load
      other PEs based on their relation to that work item.  Viewing
      more details shows a window listing all of the messages
      created during this work item along with their targets and send
      times, along with other details of the work item.

   2) Control Panel:
      - At the bottom of the window
      Checkboxes:
      - Display Pack Times
      - Display Message Sends
        These are represented by little white vertical lines at the
        time a message was created.
      - Display Idle Time
      - Display User Events
      - View n User Events
        Opens a new window showing user events on the selected PEs
      Buttons:
      - Load New Time/PE Range
        Brings up the initial dialog box to select a new range
      - Zoom In/Out
      - Zoom Selection / Load Selection
        After highlighting a section of the display by clicking and
        dragging in the time axis area, these options let you either zoom
        into the selected area or reload the selected area.


2. Usage Profile:
-----------------
   The Usage Profile window lets you see percentage-wise what each processor
   spends its time on during a specified period.

   When the window first comes up, a dialog box appears asking for the
   processor(s) you want to look at as well as the time range you want to look
   at.  This is similar to the dialog for the Timelines.

   The bottom portion of the Usage Profile window lets you adjust the scales in
   both the X and Y directions.  The X direction is useful if you are looking at
   a large number of processors.  The Y direction is useful if there are
   small-percentage items for a processor.

   The left side of the display shows a scale from 0% to 100%.  The main part of
   the display shows the statistics.  Each processor is represented by a
   vertical bar.  The top of the bar always shows the overhead time.  Below that
   is always (if exists) the idle time and then the message packing/unpacking
   times.  The rest of the bar is ordered from the bottom with the largest
   percentage items being closest to the bottom.  If you place the cursor over a
   portion of the bar, a pop-up window will appear telling you the name of the
   item, what percent of the usage it has, and the processor it is on.


3. Communication Per Processor:
-----------------
   This tool shows communication over the interval per selected
   PE. This view is in the processor domain. It can show the number of
   messages or bytes sent or received, depending on the option
   selected at the bottom of the window.


4. Communication Over Time:
-----------------
   This tool shows communication over time across all selected PEs.
   This view is in the time domain. It can show the number of messages
   or bytes sent or received, depending on the option selected at the
   bottom of the window.


5. Call Table:
-----------------
   This tool shows all the entry methods invoked by other entry
   methods. The left aligned entry method name indicates the current
   entry method, and the indented entry methods below are those called
   by the current entry method.  Enabling EP Detail or Statistics at
   the bottom shows the qualified name and parameter list of the EP
   or the number of total messages received, bytes received, and
   statistics on the received bytes, respectively.


6. View Log Files:
-----------------
   This tool shows raw log files for the selected PEs and time
   interval. The log files are parsed by Projections and event types,
   entry method names, etc. are printed rather than the raw integers
   of the actual logs.


7. Histograms:
--------------
   This tool creates histograms for various properties of the program,
   execution time, accumulated execution time, message size, and idle
   percentage.


8. Overview:
--------------
   This tool shows a high level overview of execution across the
   selected PEs and time interval. It displays a dense, quantized view
   of the execution of the program, either in terms of entry methods
   or utilization.  Essentially, it provides a coarser view of the
   same information as Timeline (see #1).


9. Animations:
--------------
   This window animates the processor usage by displaying
   different colors for different amount of usage.

   The left box allows you to select the real time between frames;
   the right box the processor time between frames.


10. Time Profile:
--------------
   This tool shows execution across the selected PEs and time
   interval. This view is in the time domain. This tool shows a high
   level overview of execution across the selected PEs and time
   interval. It displays a dense, quantized view of the execution of
   the program, either in terms of entry methods or utilization.
   Essentially, it provides a coarser view of the same information as
   Timeline (see #1).


11. Performance Counters:
--------------
   This tool shows the values of performance counters per entry point
   and PE. This option is disabled unless Charm++ was compiled with
   support for PAPI counters.


12. User Events:
--------------
   This tool shows the summation of bracketed user events per PE
   across the selected PEs and time interval.


13. User Stats Over Time:
--------------
   This tool shows the values of user stats over the program execution
   across the selected PEs and time interval. This view is in the
   time domain.


14. User Stats Per Processor:
--------------
   This tool shows the values of user stats per PE
   across the selected PEs and time interval. This view is in the
   PE domain.


15. Extrema Analysis:
--------------
   This tool identifies extreme clusters of particular attributes
   through the execution. The attribute, activity, extrema threshold,
   and number of clusters are customizable when selecting a time range.


16. Multirun Analysis:
--------------
   This tool compares multiple executions of a program to each other,
   showing how time spent in entry methods changes across the
   execution. Currently, this view only works with summary data due to
   memory constraints.


17. Noise Miner:
--------------
   This tool identifies abnormally long entry methods to detect
   symptoms consistent with computational noise.  Long events are
   filtered and clustered to provide a summary of such occurrences.


18. Streaming CCS:
--------------
   This tool uses the Converse Client Server feature of Charm++ to
   stream performance data from running programs.  To use it, the
   Charm++ program must be compiled with "-tracemode utilization", and
   executed with "++server ++server-port <port number>".


19. Memory Usage:
--------------
   This tool provides a view of memory utilization in the application
   when it is linked with the memory tracing module.
